## My Story

I grew up in Niskayuna, a small town in upstate New York. One day, I was at my friend’s house, and we found a strobelight in a room in his basement. Every flash would last a tiny fraction of a second, and in between flashes everything was completely black. It was like seeing the world one freeze frame at a time. All motion seemed choppy and the world felt completely surreal.

The next week, I brought my iPad and arrived at his house early, before all my other friends. From an old apple crate and the legs of an old telescope, we built a tripod. That was how I made my first YouTube video.

Today I live in New York City and attend Phillips Academy in Andover, MA. I love storytelling, especially through filmmaking and photography, but also design and code. I’m constantly experimenting and learning new things. I’ve worked on all sorts of projects, from 30-second shorts to 30-minute documentaries, from music videos to admissions campaigns.

<p>I'll forever be trying to escape Plat 3 in Rocket League, love cycling and playing piano, and pray to my bible of Isaac Asimov short stories every night.
