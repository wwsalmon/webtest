In summer 2017, my family and I took a trip to the American Southwest - Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Red Rock Canyon, Antelope Canyon. I brought my beefy RX10II along without any serious intention to shoot a video. Still, I ended up getting some good stuff - half a year later, I rediscovered all of the gorgeous footage and decided to put a little travel film together.
