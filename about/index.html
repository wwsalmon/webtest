      <p><b>Do to learn, not learn to do.</b> All of what I've learned I've learned by diving in and working on projects. I'm experienced in cinematography, video editing, photo editing, graphic design, motion graphics, and front-end web development. I'm proficient in Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, After Effects, and Lightroom; HTML5, CSS3, and JQuery.</p>

      <p>I'm experienced at working as a part of a team and with clients, from Holland4Harlem's campaign team to Phillips Academy's Admissions Office. I am able to work collaboratively, but also independently with little guidance. I can be flexible and adapt to my client's needs.</p>

      <p>I'm currently a sophomore at Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, and live in New York City. I love playing Rocket League, playing piano, geeking out over tech, running, and Asimov's Robot short stories.</p>
