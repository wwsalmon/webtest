# wwsalmon.com Webtest

This repository used to be the development/staging repo for my main website. The last version on this repo was 0.4.6, before this was migrated to the main repo. Going forward, development will take place on the development branch on the [wwsalmon.github.io repo](https://github.com/wwsalmon/wwsalmon.github.io).

~~This repo hosts the latest test version of my main website, not just small iterations but complete from-the-ground-up changes, whether in design or changing code structure and generators.~~

## ~~Current Version: 0.4.6~~

You can find documentation of all versions at my [wwsalmon.com archive](wwsalmon.com/archive).

~~This is currently version 0.4.6; the current live version is 0.4.5, orr. built as videoportfolio2. 0.4.6 is the exact same as 0.4.5 as an end product, however it's been rebuilt from the ground up using Jekyll instead of just raw code.~~
